Capstone IV
This was my final project for Level 1 of my bootcamp.
This tasks assumes you are a store master for a "nike warehouse" and performs the following functions as an inventory program
  * Search products by code.
  * Determine the product with the lowest quantity and restock it.
  * Determine the product with the highest quantity.
  * Calculate the value of each item entry, based on the quantity and cost of the
    item. The value is calculated by multiplying the cost by the quantity for each
    item entered.
    
In order to run this program you will need a Python IDE
